## The Workshop Ethos

This project is a quiet space for focused work. We value clarity, simplicity, and a respectful approach to both code and communication.

## How to Offer Your Craft

1.  **Observe the Current State:** Before proposing a change, take a moment to understand the existing mechanisms.
2.  **Propose a Refinement:** If you envision an improvement or a new feature, consider opening an issue first to discuss the idea. This ensures our efforts are aligned.
3.  **Craft Your Contribution:**
    *   **Branching:** Create a new branch for your work: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name` or `git checkout -b fix/issue-description`.
    *   **Code Style:** We favor clear, readable code. Consistency is appreciated.
    *   **Commit Messages:** Describe your changes with a concise, informative message. Imagine explaining your work to a fellow craftsman.
    *   **Testing:** If your contribution introduces new functionality or fixes a bug, please include relevant tests.
4.  **Present Your Work:** Submit a Pull Request. In your description, explain the purpose of your changes and any observations you made during your work.
